##jQueryTO

jQueryTO is back for another year, March 15-16. Two days of awesome are planned with great speakers and tons of JavaScript goodness. Check out their [official website](http://jqueryto.com).

And because they are such awesome people they have extended a discount to the OttawaJS community. Use code "ottawajs" to get $50 off of your ticket price. Thanks again to the organizers of jQueryTO!
