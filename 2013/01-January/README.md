###Intro
Happy New Year, everyone!
Welcome to the January edition of JS.Headlines(), the only news that you care about, covering everything javascript and this month roundup will be WebGL-centric.

###News
* AGI has worked with NORAD Tracks Santa this year to develop a 3D web map that shows Santa’s real-time position on a 3D globe on Christmas Eve. [Here’s a blog post with the technical details on AGI’s website](http://cesium.agi.com/2012/11/30/NORAD-Tracks-Santa-Tech-Preview/).
* [100,000 Stars](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/stars/) is a fantastic visualization on chrome experiments website for astronomers or anyone interested in our stellar neighborhood.
* Stuck on an idea for your next startup? I’m considering a “Big Data tablet network for business execs”, and if you’re looking for similar inspiration yourself, you should try Peter O’Shaughnessy’s [Future Technologies Idea Generator](http://future-tech-idea-generator.herokuapp.com/).
* vw3 is a virtual worlds game engine in being created at Middle Tennessee State University; it supports import from Maya files including skeletal animations, [and has a little demo of that on the front page](http://vw3.cs.mtsu.edu/), but head on to Youtube for a [tutorial for the pipeline](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1pUfEmNOzA).
* [Inka3D](http://www.inka3d.com/), a tool for exporting Maya content for use in WebGL apps, has reached version 1.5. You can now export scenes from Maya to WebGL with no polygon limit, and create characters with hundreds of bones.
* Verold Studio is a tool that makes it possible to collaborate online with 3D models, and it uses Three.js heavily. To give back to the library, [they’ve contributed their code that converts FBX files to Three.js JSON files](http://verold.com/blog/2012/11/27/designing-the-fbx-converter-for-threejs).
* [SpaceGoo](http://www.spacegoo.com/) have been featured in many blogs in the past… and now their complete website interface is in WebGL! Xavier writes “And too bad for those who have not enabled WebGL, there is no fallback version for them XD”.
* On the subject of WebGL-based sites, onGameStart US is a new conference for web gaming in New York this year, hosted by Michal Budzynski. Collin Hover is putting together [a fun 3D site about it](http://ongamestart.us/).
* [Some new cool medical imaging](http://sectional-anatomy.org/), from Tobias Rautenkranz: the standard view is of images on a 2D canvas, but if you go to “Overview” on the right and then “3D”, you get a volume-rendered version.
* [TeeChart](http://www.steema.com/files/public/teechart/html5/v2012.12.14.1.4/demos/) is a JavaScript charting library, with [3D WebGL support using Three.js](http://www.steema.com/files/public/teechart/html5/v2012.12.14.1.4/demos/canvas/webgl/index.html).
* [glslmin](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/glslmin) is a CLI tool for minifying WebGL shaders by Chris Dickinson.
* Have you written an HTML5 game you’d like people to hear about (tinhk about the Asteroid game presented by Simon back in September)? Ivan Kuckir has put together [Spread My Game](http://www.spreadmygame.com/), a website where you can post a link.
* For readers of Japanese (or Google Translate users), here’s [a tutorial on writing shaders](http://www.atmarkit.co.jp/ait/articles/1211/26/news012.html).
* [10 PRINT](http://10print.org/) is a book about a one-line Commodore 64 BASIC program, and Daniel Haehn has knocked together [a quick 3D version of the pattern](http://lessons.goxtk.com/16/) that program creates using XTK/WebGL.
* Keen on Dart, and keen on Three.js? [You should check out three.dart](https://github.com/threeDart/three.dart).
